# CarlG0123's Github

## Bio
I am a Undergraduate Computer Science Major at Wesleyan University. Over the past years, I have worked on several projects, most of them being mobile apps. Although many of my projects concern app development, I am beginning to branch into web development. Computer Science has always been a huge passion of mine, and I really enjoy how I am able to incorporate concepts that I have learned in classses such as Differential Equations, Information Theory, Discrete Mathematics, or Linear Algebra, into my programs. I have taken classes in multiple computer science topics, such as Expert Systems, Compilers and Interpreters, Computer Architecture, Numerical Methods, and even have done, individual research into subjects such as quantum computing and the connectome.

## Projects
### Harker Robotics - Scouting App
One of my largest project is developing a data collection app for the FRC Harker Robotics Team. It functions as a partner app with another app that another member of the team developed to store and view all the data. My app focused on allowing to user to intutively and quickly record data as each match was happening. At first the UI may seem confusing, but for more details on how the competition actually worked, check out [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mew6G_og-PI). I worked with multiple menu input fields, toggles, and buttons to create a intuitive, efficient, and fun data collection process. I also used a huffman's code (based on the probability of typing certain letters, numbers, or punctuation) in order to compact the number of bits (especially in the 'comments' section) used to display the data in the QR code.

### NHSGA - IOS Puzzle Platformer 'Sprout' Game (Made as part of a team of 5)
This is another one of my larger projects. I developed this IOS game while at the National High School Game Academy at CMU in Pennsylvania. I worked on this game as a programmer in a team of 5 developers (2 artists, 2 programmers, 1 sound designer). In addition to my role as a programmer, I designed the puzzles and worked on creating a story with an emotional pull based around an old man trying to save a dying plant. Coding wise, I implemented swipe controls and different timing and switch mechanisms to create each of the puzzles. The swipe controls took a particularly long time because we needed to have numerous play testers in order to properly calibrate the sensitivity of the swipes. This was my first IOS App that I worked on.
_Due to size limitations on uploads to github, I could not upload a build of the app because of the game's graphical elemnents._
